# Target Hosts Example
# Each line contains one compute host name
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored

# Production compute nodes
compute-node-01.example.com
compute-node-02.example.com
compute-node-03.example.com

# Development compute nodes
dev-compute-01.example.com
dev-compute-02.example.com

# Test compute nodes

# High-performance compute nodes (for special workloads)
# hpc-compute-01.example.com
# hpc-compute-02.example.com

# Note: The script will automatically load-balance VMs across these hosts
# by selecting the host with the lowest current VM count
